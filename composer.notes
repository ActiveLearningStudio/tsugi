We cannot advance past:

        "twig/twig": "v2.6.2",
        "silex/silex": "v2.0.4",

Twig 2.13.1 could run - but Silex experienced deprecation errors

If we upgraded to the latest (still deprecated) silex 2.3.0, it wanted to move 
to Symfony 4 and a bunch of other things.

So we have a standoff. Honestly - we need to kick Silex right out
of the code base.
